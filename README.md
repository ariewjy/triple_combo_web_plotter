# Welcome to Online Petrophysics Plotter :wave:

## This is a documentation of online website to plot LAS file data into a triple combo plot and formation evaluation plot.

The website is available at __www.plotpetrophysics.xyz__ 

## Features:
- Adjustable depth, color, and curve-shading.
- A built in example from pre-loaded LAS file.
- Ability to calculate Rw from Salinity and Temperature.
- Ability to calculate VSH from Gamma-Ray or Density-Neutron logs.
- Ability to calculate porosity (total or effective) from Density only or Density-Neutron combination (Crossplot).
- Ability to calculate water saturation (Sw) using Archie's equation. 
- Ability to download all plots in a pdf format. 

## Some Limitations:
- Only accepting LAS file 2.0.
- Limited bandwith, make sure to select and adjust one feature at a time.
- The website is not having ssl certificate _(the "not secure" warning on your browser tab)_. __Dont worry about this, as I don't collect any private information whatsoever.__

## Exciting Future Plans (_ranked from the easiest_):
- Adding histogram and scatter plot for curves.
- Adding zonation/ top formation to the plot.
- Adding integrated plot where Triple Combo and Formation Evaluation tracks is available in a single plot.
- Adding ability to adjust the plot size, in order to facilitate longer vertical log-type pdf file.
- Adding ability to download the calculated VSH, POR, and SW into a CSV format file/ LAS file.

## Tutorial:
In this tutorial, we will go step by step to create a decent plot based on the preloaded file:

1. Upload your LAS file or use the pre-loaded file:

2. Display the well information based on the LAS file header:

3. Select the curves based on well information. The triple combo plot typically consist of Gamma-Ray, Resistivity, and Density-Neutron logs:

4. Adjusting the plot setting such as interval (top and bottom depth), color, scale, and shading:
